- You will have to dowload the 'thermostat_upgraded.json';
- Now you go to 'widget library', go to your widget pack, click in the '+' symbol and click in the 'import widget type';
- And now you just have to select the '.json' file you downloaded.

### Now you just have to save your package and import it in the dashboard!!
